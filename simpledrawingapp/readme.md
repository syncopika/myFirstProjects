log of versions...    
1. ver11192015.html - this is a more improved version than the one outside this folder.   
2. ver112115.html - this is a canvas with 'onion-skin' functionality. hopefully on the way to something more useful for an aspiring animator like me!

ideas:  
1. add undo/redo     
2. add color wheel  
3. more brushes  
4. import background pictures  
5. make gif?? :D
