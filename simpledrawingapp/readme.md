log of versions...  
1. ver11192015.html - this is a more improved version than the one outside this folder.  
<br>
2. ver112115.html - this is a canvas with 'onion-skin' functionality. hopefully on the way to something more useful for an aspiring animator like me! however, this version is still buggy because canvas0 (the initial canvas) seems to be active when it shouldn't be (i.e. if you go up a page and then go back to 0, it suddenly becomes permenently active).

ideas:  
1. add undo/redo     
2. add color wheel  
3. more brushes  
4. import background pictures  
5. make gif?? :D
