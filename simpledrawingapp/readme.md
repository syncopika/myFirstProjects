log of versions...  
1. ver11192015.html - this is a more improved version than the one outside this folder.  
<br>
2. ver112115.html - this is a canvas with 'onion-skin' functionality. hopefully on the way to something more useful for an aspiring animator like me! however, this version is still buggy because canvas0 (the initial canvas) seems to be active when it shouldn't be (i.e. if you go up a page and then go back to 0, it suddenly becomes permenently active).  
<br>
3. ver112215.html - I binded the spacebar to addLayer() function and utilized Bootstrap better for a uniform layout. I still can't figure out the problem with canvas0 but at least everything else seems to work okay. I think I'll take a break from this for a bit and learn about web scraping, but I hope I come back to this! 
<br>  
4. ver112915.html - added a color picker! well, more like custom color maker. I also learned that I need to be mindful of method names and how there are separate ones for jQuery and regular ECMAScript, i.e. val() and .value. 

ideas:  
1. add undo/redo     
2. add color wheel  
3. more brushes (make a javascript library maybe?) 
4. import background pictures  
5. make gif?? :D
